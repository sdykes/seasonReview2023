Current practice estimates orchard fruit load based on the qualitative assessment of fruit number per tree and historical orchard yield, or manually counting a subsample of trees. This review considers technological aids assisting these estimates, in terms of: (i) improving sampling strategies by the number of units to be counted and their selection; (ii) machine vision for the direct measurement of fruit number and size on the canopy; (iii) aerial or satellite imagery for the acquisition of information on tree structural parameters and spectral indices, with the indirect assessment of fruit load; (iv) models extrapolating historical yield data with knowledge of tree management and climate parameters, and (v) technologies relevant to the estimation of harvest timing such as heat units and the proximal sensing of fruit maturity attributes. Machine vision is currently dominating research outputs on fruit load estimation, while the improvement of sampling strategies has potential for a widespread impact. Techniques based on tree parameters and modeling offer scalability, but tree crops are complicated (perennialism). The use of machine vision for flowering estimates, fruit sizing, external quality evaluation is also considered. The potential synergies between technologies are highlighted.},

Mountains are however amongst the most fragile experiencing extreme weather conditions, like rising temperature, uneven precipitation, spring hailstorms, and cold waves which severely affect the production of temperate crops. The traditional apple cultivation in Uttarakhand hills is under stress due to climate change. The instances of these adverse conditions impact could be observed on plant phenology, bud bursting, blossoming, fruit retention, fruit yield and quality. The rising temperature widely affects the chilling requirement for apple fruit, which is the pre-requisite for blossoming of apple fruit. Insufficient chilling greatly influence fruit set whereas, hailstorm during spring season causes frost injury and deteriorate the fruit quality. Evidences of poor climatic condition leads to the shifting of apple cultivation towards crop like kiwi and pomegranate. Development of low chill cultivars with greater adaptation is the viable approach that can be adopted to fetch good production of apple fruit and to maintain the commercial importance of apple fruit in hilly regions. Under the stressful condition, Anna variety of apple performs well and can with stand under low chilling requirements in lower hills of Uttarakhand.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            A large literature has documented the effects of weather on agricultural yields. However, weather not only impacts the quantity produced, but also the quality of the product. Due to data limitations, the quality effects have primarily been studied using lab experiments for specific attributes, and the financial implications for farmers of a quality effect are less clear. Using a unique longitudinal micro-level data set of Swiss apple orchards that include information on both the quantity produced as well as the quality, we show that the latter can have an even larger effect on farm revenue. Ignoring the quality of the harvested product substantially biases the impact of weather extremes on agricultural income and the potential effects of climate change. Our quality measure is the orchard-year specific price shock. If an orchard gets a lower price for its specific apple variety compared to previous years and compared to other orchards in the same year, we observe the market’s valuation of its inferior quality accounting for overall price movements (other orchards growing same variety that year) as well as orchard specific factors (orchard fixed effects). We find that spring frost events induce farm gate price drops and thus revenue reductions of up to 2.05\% per hour of exposure.},

Accurate harvest time prediction is a challenge for fruit production in a sustainable manner, which could eventually reduce food waste. Linear models have been used to estimate period duration; however, they present variability when used to estimate the chronological time of apple tree stages. This study proposes the PredHarv model, which is a machine learning model that uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to predict the start date of the apple harvest, given the weather conditions related to the temperature expected for the period. Predictions are made from the phenological phase of the beginning of flowering, using a multivariate approach, based on the time series of phenology and meteorological data. The computational model contributes to anticipating information about the harvest date, enabling the grower to better plan activities, avoiding costs, and consequently improving productivity. We developed a prototype of the model and performed experiments with real datasets from agricultural institutions. We evaluated the metrics, and the results obtained in evaluation scenarios demonstrate that the model is efficient, has good generalizability, and is capable of improving the accuracy of the prediction results.},

Temperatures during 20 days before the harvest of McIntosh and 40 days before the harvest of Delicious and Northern Spy influenced the rate of starch hydrolysis and thus the starch index reading. Low temperatures favored the conversion of starch to sugar and high temperatures the reverse. This resulted in low starch index readings at first acceptable harvest in the southern apple growing areas of the province and high readings in the northern areas. Since the average interval from full bloom to first acceptable harvest in Ontario is 118 days for McIntosh, 132 days for Delicious and 133 days for Northern Spy, the ambient temperature beginning 98 days after full bloom for McIntosh, 92 days for Delicious and 93 days for Northern Spy must be considered when using the starch test to determine first acceptable harvest date.},

We demonstrate statistical methods that are appropriate for making the comparisons of interest and discuss the possible cause of differences between operators and between devices. We also discuss how the mechanical properties of the devices may affect results and consider implications for their practical use.

in the Baltic, where thousands of varieties of fruit trees from throughout
the world are grown and tested. Over time, a huge knowledge base has been
accumulated, but most of the observational data are stored in archives in
paper format. We have digitized a small part of the full flowering
phenological data of apple trees (Malus domestica) over the period of 1959 to 2019 for 17
varieties of apple trees, a significant step for horticulture and
agricultural economics in Latvia. Climate change has led to significant
changes in the phenology of apple trees as all varieties, autumn, summer and
winter, have begun to flower earlier: from 2002 to 2019, on average full
flowering was recorded to have taken place around 21 May, whereas for the
period 1959–1967 it occurred around 27–28 May. To develop better-quality phenological predictions and to take account of
the fragmentary nature of phenological data, in our study we assessed the
performance of three meteorological data sets – gridded observation data
from E-OBS, ERA5-Land reanalysis data and direct observations from a distant
meteorological station – in simple phenological degree-day models. In the
first approximation, the gridded E-OBS data set performs best in our
phenological model.},

It is a region of highly variable and sporadic rainfall,

areas having over 2000 hours per year.
Hawke’s Bay is less windy than many other coastal
areas of New Zealand, experiencing a high frequency
of very light winds. Consequently, a large number of
frosts occur during the cooler months of the year.
Much of the rain in Hawke’s Bay occurs when the wind
directions are predominantly easterly or southerly.
Rainfall is extremely variable in spring and summer
when westerly winds prevail over the country. In most
years insufficient rainfall (dry spells) results in a total
depletion of soil moisture to the extent that plant
growth ceases. The high country areas of Hawke’s Bay
are exposed and gales occur frequently. Showers of
snow are frequent during the winter months in cold
southerly conditions.},

	abstract = {Financial returns to New Zealand orchardists could be increased if bruise damage to apples and its visual consequences were reduced. Comprehension of the variability of susceptibility to the bruising of apples associated with either preharvest, harvest or postharvest influences is fundamental to reducing bruise damage. Standard impacts to apples have been generated in many ways and bruise severity has generally been represented as bruise volume per unit energy. In this study bruise severity was represented by a) the diameter of a bruise generated by a sphere of mass and radius of curvature similar to that of apples and whose impact energy (0.32 J) was similar to apple-apple collisions that occurred during grading or b) the damage that apples incurred by grading in a standard manner. Bruise colour was also measured and visual differences between dark and light brown 'Granny Smith' bruised tissue were associated with a 5° difference in hue angle, as measured by a Minolta chromameter. In 1990 from a survey of 'Granny Smith' orchards it was determined that the range in bruise diameter of individual fruit was 17\% (fruit mass range; 0.157-0.207 kg) and in 1991 was 63\% (fruit mass range; 0.098-0.278 kg). The between-season difference in mean bruise diameter was 2.8\%. Over the two years it was found that bruise diameter of fruit from orchards producing either the most or least bruise susceptible fruit differed by an average of 6.5\%. In 1991 bruise diameter generated from a standard impact was related to grader damage (R2 = 0.49) and the slope of this relationship indicated that small increases in bruise diameter equated to large increases in grader damage. In both years the most bruise susceptible fruit had higher levels of tissue phosphorus, calcium and nitrogen than least susceptible fruit. In one year of the survey bruise diameter was positively related to apple calcium content and apple mass with grader damage positively related to phosphorus content. In a within-orchard study between-tree variation in bruise diameter of 'Royal Gala' (11\%) exceeded that of 'Granny Smith' (4\%). Bruise diameter of least bruise susceptible fruit was more consistently related to starch index, soluble solids, fruit mass and firmness than bruise diameter of the most susceptible fruit. Harvesting 'Granny Smith' and 'Royal Gala' early rather than later in the season resulted in bruise diameter reductions of 5\% and 21\% respectively. Within-tree position of apples did not consistently influence susceptibility to bruising in either variety. Foliar sprays of calcium (CaCl2) and phosphorus (H3PO4) did not influence fruit mineral contents or susceptibility to bruising. Apples from non-irrigated "Braeburn" trees had smaller bruise diameters (6\%), less calcium and tended to have more dry matter than apples from normally irrigated trees. 'Golden Delicious' apples harvested later in the day were less susceptible to bruise damage (7.3\%) than those harvested early in the morning; elevated temperatures and reduced water status were identified as causative factors. As temperature increased from 0 to 20°C susceptibility to bruising showed a non-linear reduction. Bruise diameter and grader damage reduced 5\% and 24\% respectively when 'Granny Smith' apples were bruised at 20°C rather than when bruised at 0°C. If 'Royal Gala' were cooled to 2°C and then rewarmed to 20°C they sustained 36\% less grader damage than if graded immediately after harvest. Useful reductions in grader damage (25\%) were achieved by holding freshly harvested 'Royal Gala' at ambient temperatures for one day before grading. Storing the bruise susceptible cultivar 'Splendour' apples for 54 h at 20°C before bruising resulted in a 9\% reduction in bruise diameter. A 24 h delay in pre-cooling of 'Royal Gala' was associated with a 0.5\% weight loss and a 3\% reduction in bruise diameter; delays of more than 24 h before pre-cooling were associated with enhanced ripening and greater weight loss but no measurable change in susceptibility to bruising. In the 1991 survey, there were large between-orchard differences in hue angle of bruised 'Granny Smith' apple tissue (16°) and light brown bruise tissue was associated with higher fruit nitrogen content (R2 = 0.55). Between-tree differences in hue angle of bruised tissue from 'Royal Gala' apples were large (15°) but with 'Granny Smith' were insignificant. Differences in bruised tissue colour due to enhanced maturity or within-tree position in both cultivars were not consistent. Cool storing 'Splendour' for 414 h before bruising appeared to increase bruise lightness.},

              India is the fifth-largest apple producer in the world with more than 2 MT per year. Mechanical damage such as bruises of apples (
              Malus domestica
              Borkh.), which can result in considerable wastage and decline in quality, is a major problem of the apple industry. On-site investigations of apple orchard management strategies to reduce bruises in Northern India were conducted by the first author in collaboration with the University of Bonn. The apple industry including the farmers is in a continuous process of reducing losses caused by mechanical damage. Apple bruises can develop along the whole value chain. Orchard management offers countermeasures to reduce bruise susceptibility of the apples. At harvest, bruises can be caused by impact and compression forces due to unsuitable practices. This review explains the formation and development of bruises, followed by the causes of mechanical damage and orchard management measures to reduce or avoid bruises, with particular regard to India. The orchard management measures include crop load management, fruit water status and nutrient composition, maturity stage, harvest time later in the day, gentle harvest methods, packing into soft, padded bins and careful transport of the apple bins out of the orchard.},

Moisture exposure results in formation of microcracks and decreased cuticle thickness. Periderm differentiation begins in the hypodermis, but only after discontinuation of moisture exposure. Expressions of selected genes involved in cutin, wax and suberin synthesis were quantified, as were the wax, cutin and suberin compositions. Experiments were conducted in two phases. In Phase I (31 days after full bloom) the fruit surface was exposed to moisture for 6 or 12 d. Phase II was after moisture exposure had been discontinued. Unexposed areas on the same fruit served as unexposed controls. During Phase I, cutin and wax synthesis genes were down-regulated only in the moisture-exposed patches. During Phase II, suberin synthesis genes were up-regulated only in the moisture-exposed patches. The expressions of cutin and wax genes in the moisture-exposed patches increased slightly during Phase II, but the levels of expression were much lower than in the control patches. Amounts and compositions of cutin, wax and suberin were consistent with the gene expressions. Thus, moisture-induced russet is a two-step process: moisture exposure reduces cutin and wax synthesis, moisture removal triggers suberin synthesis.},

All sprays were applied at greentip, and dithianon was also applied at 10-day intervals for 5 sprays (spring program). Copper treatments were followed, or not, by a spring program of thiram, and all treatments were with or without a following summer program of thiram. Control of black spot (95\% fruit with no spot) was not achieved with copper sprays at greentip alone, although control was better than on the unsprayed treatment. All dithianon programs, and cupric hydroxide sprays followed by thiram, controlled black spot. No difference was found between formulations for either cupric hydroxide or dithianon. Copper oxychloride increased the incidence of severe russet to {\textgreater}50\% compared with the unsprayed control (28.5\%). All other treatments were satisfactory, with similar incidence of russet to the control treatment, and could be used in commercial practices.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) is an inhibitor of ethylene perception that is widely used to maintain the quality of several climacteric fruits during storage. A large body of literature now exists on the effects of 1-MCP on climacteric fruit ripening for different species and environmental conditions, presenting an opportunity to use meta-analysis to systematically dissect these effects. We classified 44 ripening indicators of climacteric fruits into five categories: physiology and biochemistry, quality, enzyme activity, color, and volatiles. Meta-analysis showed that 1-MCP treatment reduced 20 of the 44 indicators by a minimum of 22\% and increased 6 indicators by at least 20\%. These effects were associated with positive effects on delaying ripening and maintaining quality. Of the seven moderating variables, species, 1-MCP concentration, storage temperature and time had substantial impacts on the responses of fruit to 1-MCP treatment. Fruits from different species varied in their responses to 1-MCP, with the most pronounced responses observed in rosaceous fruits, especially apple, European pear fruits, and tropical fruits. The effect of gaseous 1-MCP was optimal at 1 μl/l, with a treatment time of 12–24 h, when the storage temperature was 0 °C for temperate fruits or 20 °C for tropical fruits, and when the shelf temperature was 20 °C, reflecting the majority of experimental approaches. These findings will help improve the efficacy of 1-MCP application during the storage of climacteric fruits, reduce fruit quality losses and increase commercial value.},

              Little information is available on vegetative and generative performance of apple cultivars during the early growth of trees in orchards. The aim of this five-year study was to evaluate 2 vegetative (trunk cross sectional area (TCSA) and tree height (TH)) and 7 generative parameters (tree yield (TY), fruit number per tree (FNT), crop load (CL), fruit diameter (FD), shape index (SI), fruit surface color (FSC) and fruit color intensity (FCI)) and their inter-correlations (Pearson correlation, regression analyses and PCA) for young apple trees, on 9 apple cultivars (‘Jugala’, ‘Galaval’, ‘Gala Venus Fengal’, ‘Gala Decarli-Fendeca’, ‘Gala Schnitzer (S) Schniga’, ‘Fuji September Wonder’, ‘Crimson Crisp (Co-op 39)’, ‘Jeromine’, and ‘Red Idared’) in a slender spindle training system (2597 trees ha
              −1
              ) and on 4 apple cultivars (‘Wilton’s Red Jonaprince’, ‘Red Cap Valtod (S)’, ‘Early Red One’, and ‘Red Topaz’) in a super spindle training system (5194 trees ha
              −1
              ) in Eastern Hungary. The strongest vegetative growth was observed in ‘Red Idared’, while the weakest was in ‘Early Red One’. Most ‘Gala’ mutants showed high yields in all years, except for ‘Galaval’. On the 6 year-old trees, the lowest tree yield was found in ‘Fuji September Wonder’ (8.2 kg tree
              −1

The lowest shape index (0.73) was found in ‘Red Topaz’, while the highest (0.92) was in ‘Red Idared’. The majority of the cultivars reached very good fruit surface color (80–100\%). The lowest fruit surface color (40\%) was observed in ‘Gala Schnitzer (S) Schniga’, while the highest (100\%) was in ‘Jeromine’ and ‘Early Red One’. The highest fruit color intensity was observed in most cultivars with the exception of ‘Jeromine’, ‘Gala Schnitzer (S) Schniga’ and’Fuji September Wonder’. In addition, correlation and regression analyses revealed strong and significant (

              In order to define the effects of fruit crop load on the distribution and utilization of carbon and nitrogen in dwarf apple trees, we conducted three crop load levels (High-crop load, 6 fruits per trunk cross-sectional area (cm
              2
              , TCA)), Medium-crop load (4 fruits cm
              −2
              TCA), Low-crop load (2 fruits cm
              −2
              TCA)) in 2014 and 2015. The results indicated that the
              15
              N derived from fertilizer (Ndff) values of fruits decreased with the reduction of crop load, but the Ndff values of annual branches, leaves and roots increased. The plant
              15
              N-urea utilization rates on Medium and Low-crop load were 1.12–1.35 times higher than the High-crop load. With the reduction of crop load, the distribution rate of

              C and
              15

Therefore, a non-destructive measurement method with high versatility is essential. The objective of this study was to establish a non-destructive monitoring system for estimating the fresh weight and leaf area of trellised crops. The data were collected from a greenhouse with sweet peppers (Capsicum annuum var. annuum); the target growth factors were the crop fresh weight and leaf area. The crop fresh weight was estimated based on the total system weight and volumetric water content using a simple formula. The leaf area was estimated using top-view images of the crops and a convolutional neural network (ConvNet). The estimated crop fresh weight and leaf area exhibited average R2 values of 0.70 and 0.95, respectively. The simple calculation was able to avoid overfitting with fewer limitations compared with the previous study. ConvNet was able to analyze raw images and evaluate the leaf area without additional sensors and features. As the simple calculation and ConvNet could adequately estimate the target growth factors, the monitoring system can be used for data collection in practice owing to its versatility. Therefore, the proposed monitoring system can be widely applied for diverse data analyses.},

            The leaf area index (LAI) is a biophysical crop parameter of great interest for agronomists and plant breeders. Direct methods for measuring LAI are normally destructive, while indirect methods are either costly or require long pre- and post-processing times. In this study, a novel deep learning-based (DL) model was developed using RGB nadir-view images taken from a high-throughput plant phenotyping platform for LAI estimation of maize. The study took place in a commercial maize breeding trial during two consecutive growing seasons. Ground-truth LAI values were obtained non-destructively using an allometric relationship that was derived to calculate the leaf area of individual leaves from their main leaf dimensions (length and maximum width). Three convolutional neural network (CNN)-based DL model approaches were proposed using RGB images as input. One of the models tested is a classification model trained with a set of RGB images tagged with previously measured LAI values (classes). The second model provides LAI estimates from CNN-based linear regression and the third one uses a combination of RGB images and numerical data as input of the CNN-based model (multi-input model). The results obtained from the three approaches were compared against ground-truth data and LAI estimations from a classic indirect method based on nadir-view image analysis and gap fraction theory. All DL approaches outperformed the classic indirect method. The multi-input\_model showed the least error and explained the highest proportion of the observed LAI variance. This work represents a major advance for LAI estimation in maize breeding plots as compared to previous methods, in terms of processing time and equipment costs.},

              ) and codling moth (
              Cydia pomonella
              ) were key pests, and implementation of pest control was based on forecasting and warning systems. During the project, orchards in which IPM was implemented and in which farmers applied conventional practices were compared. In nine provinces in which IPM projects were carried out in 1999, the damage due to codling moth was 0–1.3\% in IPM orchards while it was 0.4–21.8\% in nearby non‐IPM orchards. It is clear that damage did not reach the acceptable threshold level of 2\% in any of the IPM orchards, while damage was much higher than the threshold in conventionally‐farmed orchards. The number of fungicide applications against apple scab decreased to 5–6 applications from 10–15 applications in the Eğirdir district of the Isparta Province in 1996 as a result of IPM implementation. No insecticides were applied against codling moth in IPM orchards in the Nigde Province in 1998 and 1999 because population levels of the pest were low and under the economic threshold. Apple producers received training and 1200 producers from Central Anatolia became experts in IPM for their own orchards, learning to make appropriate decisions about pest control. The Apple IPM Guideline was prepared and disseminated. In Turkey modern equipment for forecasting and warning systems was employed and, in the last decade, forecasting and warning networks have been improved. Computer‐based systems have increased the speed and accuracy of forecasting as well as decreasing its costs. A computerized national forecasting network in apple orchards now transmits data from the field to system headquarters automatically. The national forecasting network has been expanded and covered 12 208 800 apple trees in 34 provinces in 2006, using 115 electronic forecasting and warning stations.},

              The fungus
              Venturia inaequalis
              infects members of the Maloideae, and causes the disease apple scab, the most important disease of apple worldwide. The early elucidation of the gene‐for‐gene relationship between
              V. inaequalis
              and its host
              Malus
              has intrigued plant pathologists ever since, with the identification of 17 resistance (
              R
              )–avirulence (
              Avr
              ) gene pairings. The
              Avr
              gene products are presumably a subset of the total effector arsenal of
              V. inaequalis
              (predominantly proteins secreted
              in planta
              assumed to facilitate infection). The supposition that effectors from
              V. inaequalis
              act as suppressors of plant defence is supported by the ability of the pathogen to penetrate the cuticle and differentiate into large pseudoparenchymatous structures, termed stromata, in the subcuticular space, without the initiation of an effective plant defence response. If effectors can be identified that are essential for pathogenicity, the corresponding
              R
              genes will be durable and would add significant value to breeding programmes. An
              R
              gene cluster in
              Malus
              has been cloned, but no
              V. inaequalis
              effectors have been characterized at the molecular level. However, the identification of effectors is likely to be facilitated by the resolution of the whole genome sequence of
              V. inaequalis

              Life cycle:
              V. inaequalis
              is a hemibiotroph and overwinters as pseudothecia (sexual fruiting bodies) following a phase of saprobic growth in fallen leaf tissues. The primary inoculum consists of ascospores, which germinate and penetrate the cuticle. Stromata are formed above the epidermal cells but do not penetrate them. Cell wall‐degrading enzymes are only produced late in the infection cycle, raising the as yet unanswered question as to how
              V. inaequalis
              gains nutrients from the host. Conidia (secondary inoculum) arise from the upper surface of the stromata, and are produced throughout the growing season, initiating multiple rounds of infection.
            
            
              Venturia inaequalis as a model pathogen of a woody host:
              V. inaequalis
              can be cultured and is amenable to crossing
              in vitro
              , enabling map‐based cloning strategies. It can be transformed readily, and functional analyses can be conducted by gene silencing. Expressed sequence tag collections are available to aid in gene identification. These will be complemented by the whole genome sequence, which, in turn, will contribute to the comparative analysis of different races of
              V. inaequalis
              and plant pathogens within the Dothideomycetes.},
