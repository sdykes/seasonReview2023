Quarto and associated files for Rockit Apple Season review 2023

This is the central repository for the Season Review 2023 document.  The book is compiled in Quarto and each chapter is an individual .qmd file (e.g. Introduction.qmd).  Quarto files are combination of markdown and code chunks of R, python, SQL etc each chapter begins with a 1st order heading:

# Introduction {#sec-intro}

Author:  Stuart Dykes & Dharini Marinkovich

## 2023 growing season

The {#sec-intro} is how each section can be cross referenced in this case I would use [chapter -@sec-intro
